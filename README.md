Stan Levey: Jazz Heavyweight by Frank R. Hayde,Charlie Watts Book Review

Name: John and Tina
Rating: 5.0 out of 5 stars
Title: This is a great history on a (previous to me) not well known iconic jazz drummer.
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on February 10, 2020
Review: The first thing I did was purchase 3 CDs that tended to feature Stan Levey. I had some on the Getz and Adderly ones in my stores of great music.
This is such a great uplifting narrative on a (to me) not well known drummer. His story is a great rags to riches story. The RICHES are his victories in life, family, overcoming poverty lifestyle, overcoming heroin addiction. Stan Levey was a self taught, extremely humble, super talented drummer. Let's add that Stan Levey was a model human being. Good photos provided. His kit was actually set up for a left-handed drummer as Stan did now know how to set up a kit. The only possible negative comment by a reader is the writing "may" have been better. I really do not think so. It served the story well. It is his story, the civil rights movement, the jazz and drug scene, the coming up rough in the "city of brotherly love" as a boxer. His healing relationships. Prison experience. Upcoming jazz greats of the time.
I'd give TEN stars if possible .

Title: Jazz Heavyweight Indeed!
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on April 19, 2021
Review: Fascinating biography about a drummer who was a seminal part of early bebop, playing with Bird and Diz in the early days. Stan Levey went on to play with Stan Kenton and from there pursued a busy and highly diversified career on the West Coast, playing in the studios and in the Los Angeles jazz scene. He was an outstanding drummer and, by all accounts, an exemplary human being as well. I read the entire book in about one sitting.

Title: Fabulous book!
Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on March 16, 2016
Review: I picked this up the night it arrived and didn't put it down until I had read every last word and footnote. It is a fabulous read. There was a lot about Stan Levey that I had known about but when you see the record set straight, often in his own words, the big picture comes together. One great thing about this book is that you get a general chronology, starting at the roots and flowering into a career in full blossom. As the title suggests, Stan was also a boxing champion and the way the narrative weaves together his drumming and his boxing is enthralling. Finally, all the dots are connected in such a way -- it's beautifully written -- that the reader is left edified with a deeper understanding of Stan Levey and his contributions, but also of the times and characters (Bird, Miles, Feldman, Stitt, etc.) that inform us today. Love it! Buy it!

Date: Reviewed in the United States üá∫üá∏ on November 13, 2018
Review: Stan Levy was playing with the top men in Jazz when he was 16 years old. He had no training just picked up the drums on his own. Through out his career he played with many great bands, traveled the world and ended his playing career as a musician in the Hollywood studios playing for most of the movies being made. After he retired form the studios he became a well know photographer for the stars. Oh , I forgot , he was also a Heavy weight professional boxer!

Review: Great book, taking me back to an incredible time. Stan was an important part of Jazz. I took lessons from Stan Levey in the 50's, which was really, an incredible time. Indeed, many thanks for the wonderful memories.
